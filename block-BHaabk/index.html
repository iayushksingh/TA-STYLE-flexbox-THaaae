<!-- 
1. Create a simple page having a header, main content, and a footer.

2. Inside the header keep the brand name to the left and all the navigation to the right.

4. Inside the main content take an article section having two columns. In the first column put a heading and some introductory text of the article and in the second column take an image.

5. After the article section, take a gallery section, in which there will be two rows and in both the row there will be three columns. Each column must have a different image.

6. After the gallery section footer will come.

7. Use flexbox properties and values to create columns.

                        You speak dog better than you think you do. You may not be fluent; that would require actually being a dog. 
                        But if you went to live in a dogs-only world, you’d be pretty good at understanding what they’re saying. 
                        You can tell a nervous yip from a menacing growl, a bark that says hello from a bark that says get lost. 
                        You can read the body language that says happy, that says sad, that says tired, that says scared, that says Please, please, please play with me right now! 
                        Think that’s not a big deal? Then answer this: What does a happy bird look like? A sad lion? You don’t know, but dog talk you get.
